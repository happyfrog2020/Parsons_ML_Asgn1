      "\") This tort reform debate is extremely hot in the sense that although there are no reasonable people in favor of tort reform, it is the position pushed forward by the owners of Conngress and the courts. Still, those owners of government do not get to vote in this country (USA), and they must convince the voters to vote for the political candidates that will do their biddingsuch candidates are nearly always a member of one or the other of the two major political parties (about half from one party, half from the other). So the hot debate is not so much a partisan debate along \"\"party lines\"\" (note you will not be able to see such lines ona cloudy day, so don't bother to look for them), as it is along the lines of which elected or appointed officials are willing to come out of the closet as kept mistresses, and openly do the bidding of their masters. It's a true nail-biter. The \"\"debate\"\" has been keeping \"\"voters\"\" on the edge of their seats for years, even though numerous laws have been passed that could count as tort reform, if the counters were honest. For example, the 1995 Securities Litigation Reform Act, and numerous court decisisons (there's one in front of the Supremem Court nowwonder if the little guy will win?) which limits the ability of defrauded mom and pop investors in teh stock market to sue fraudulent companiesmany of which are operating under the guise of a Fortune 500 firm, as Enron did.\n",

      "\"Hip-Hop Is NOT Dead But Ready To \"\"Get It\"\"!!! (Calif) Hip-hop producer and west coast native E. Re-ill debuts his album “Get It”. “Get It” is the representation of E. Re-ill's mindset, \"\"I'm in a place in my life where I need to become who I am... I got to “Get It”!!! says E. Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80's, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn't), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled \"\"The War\"\". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video \"\"Straight Outta Compton\"\" E. Re-ill's older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he'll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years. Hip-Hop has always been the “in touch with your inner voice” music and then we have always informed our community of how we see the actions displayed in front of us. Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like \"\"Dark People\"\" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. \"\"I'm So Gangsta\"\" is a nice surprise!!! It is Fresh Caesar's look at the world biggest gangsta George Bush, and his fumbles with war and Katrina!!! Don't cheat yourself I'm so Gangsta is a necessary download!!! Oakland native and a brilliant lyricist Fresh Caesar (a.k.a. Omega) is currently working on his own album titled \"\"Jack London’s Square\"\". Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic. Down South/Oakland rapper, Tom-E-Gunn has the sounds of Snoop Dogg's early gangsta swag with grit of the south. These songs are actually lost demos recently found. E. Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E. Re-ill's “Get It” album is about all the aspirations that we desire in life money, success, respect, reflections of life, and excess of women and parties. This is the start of great things to come from this talented producer. iTunes search E.Re-ill (no spaces), Contact: myspace.com/ereill1 Also available on rhapsody, emusic, napster, Amazon...\"\n",

      "LittleOldMe, I agree with you on this issue. It is not POV to say Chavez is a Mexican-American. It also doesn't single him out. The primary argument against the edit seems to be that his mexican heritage somehow detracts from him. This does not seem to be a viable argument. First, you assume there is a negative connotation to being from a mexican heritage. To assume some people might view this in a negative light ignores the reality that any statement on a page can be looked at in a negative light by a person. The fact you list Chavez as an American will cause some people to look at him in a negative light. The same issue occurs with him being a union leader (people are against the union). Second, you ignore the fact far more reliable sources, dealing with far greater issues of a need for nuetrality have \"\"labeled\"\" him as a Mexican American. If the library of Congress can refer to him as a mexican american, why not wikipedia? The library of Congress is a reliable source, and not POV. It seems to me that the exclusion seems to be POV, in that it is pushing an unkown agenda. I don't know what the agenda is. Third, didn't Cesar Chavez in \"\"Cesar Chavez: Autobiography of La Causa\"\" describe himself as a \"\"mexican american working to help other mexican americans.\"\" He had duel citizenship (both USA and Mexico). Doesn't any of this matter? These are facts, not POV.\"\n",

The second keep was stronger, but again didn't really address the points above, and was more along the lines of WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS. As We66er said, removing the redlinks would leave a list of five, which defeats the object of a \"\"list\"\". On the counter side of that argument, redlinks show potential for new articles, but when there are so many redlinks, there is no need for such a list. There were many items on the list, yet only a handful were referenced, and as another said, one of the organisations on that list had been deleted previously through AfD. The strongest keep therefore was WP:STAND, but that was struck as a result of misinterpretation. This is the full reason for my close. However, deleting admins don't generally say any more than \"\"keep\"\" or \"\"delete\"\" in their closing statement, unless 1) there is a specific reason for the delete and/or 2) it was a decision that could cause controversy.

      "The lead states \"\"Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement deny that al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the World Trade Center buildings\"\". I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc). Ignorance must surely be bliss for these morons. Goodbye ye olde 'land of the free and the home of the brave'.\"\n",

If so I can correct brew's spelling in the quotation. But I would like to include that quote as it is representative of the bullshit that editors regularly deal with in the topic area.

Just because the gay Wikiproject believes things should be done a certain way and there is little dissent within the Wikiproject, does not mean that this is how things should be done in articles seemingly important to their eyes.  After all, James is a political and religious figure infitessimally more important to analyze or discuss in much less personal terms than having to do with sexuality or other habits.  After all, James wrote a treatise on smoking as repellant, but this is not so big a deal because of its lack in uniqueness or value in comparison to his policies.  Most gay Wikiproject participants admittedly find James a guilty hypocrite for all done in his name by fundamentalists, against gays.  This is essentially the problem.  The gay Wikiproject is taking a side and setting it into stone, all the while decrying \"\"persecution!\"\" when the odds and ends of Wikipedians here and there in the Wikipedia community find a problem with saying that James was \"\"indeed, gay!\"\" without proof, just a conflict of views that are veritably lost in time.  The gay Wikiproject takes speculation and purposeful homophobic defamation of the king's character and turn it into a monumental case or trial on homosexuality, probably about the king's motives in the King James Version Bible and verses used to support condemnation of homosexuality.  Don't take this personal!  The life of James has everything to do with a new and unstable, sometimes tyrannical government in power.  It has little veracity with regards to sexual conspiracies, unless one follows the king's involvement in aid to \"\"favourite\"\" Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset in trying to take another man's wife by murdering her legal husband.

      "\n",
      "Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were \"\"produced\"\" by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?\n",
      "\n",
      "You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you \"\"founded\"\" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone \"\"producing\"\" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are \"\"in it for the money\"\", yet:\n",
      "\n",
      "You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are \"\"producing\"\" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!\n",

      "You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another \"\"compatible\"\" (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the \"\"substitute\"\" puppy you decide to offer them.\n",

      "  \n",
      "You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you \"\"produce\"\" them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog's new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. \n",

      "Enric, you present an impoverished idea of what Wikipedia editors can and should do. We do not report demonstrably false information as fact just because a reliable source says it, unless we balance it. We can and should balance secondary source error with primary source fact. The requirement is that the primary source facts reported should be directly verifiable without synthesis, by any ordinary person with ordinary skill applying reasonable effort. First of all, it's worth reading WP:OR over carefully. Then look at the essay linked from the WP:OR page, WP:NOTOR. See, specifically, this example:\n",
      "A book, short story, film, or other work of fiction is a primary source for any article or topic regarding that work. Anything that can be observed by a reasonable person simply by reading the work itself, without interpretation, is not original research, but is reliance upon a primary source. This would include direct quotes or non interpretative summaries, publication dates, and any other patent information that can be observed from the work. For example, if there are multiple versions of a particular story, and one version does not have a particular character, or has extra characters, that is clear simply by reading or watching the work. The fact that one would have to read or watch the whole thing does not make the matter original research. The work is verifiable, even if it takes more time than flipping to a single page.\n",
      "Notice that the example is quite on point here: After reporting what the DoE report says is claimed in the review document about the sixteen samples, 'blah blah.' we could say, \"\"The Hagelstein paper, which was the review document, does not contain a report of 'blah blah.' However, it does contain 'bleep bleep.'\"\" And there is probably more than we can say; there is some criticism of the 2004 report in reliable source, if I'm correct. This tidbit, however, requires no source other than the 2004 DoE material.\n",
      "Notice also that we probably cannot report, for example, that \"\"The 2004 DoE report contradicted itself,\"\" unless we have secondary source on that. What we properly do is to present the elements of the (alleged) contradiction, without claiming contradiction, reliably sourced, and let the reader form his or her own conclusion. The elements are directly verifiable. The conclusion isn't.   \"\n",

In Graham's case his masonic credentials are not what \"\"make him notable\"\". It does not really matter what Graham may have valued or what he was proud of... What matters is what sources (such as historians) think is of value.  If there are sources that discuss his Masonic credentials, and talk about how they affected Graham's life and his achievements, then he would be Categorized. \n",

In fact, you don't even have to take the 4th - 31st degrees as a prerequisite (you can jump right from being a 3rd degree to being 32nd).  Now, if Graham had been a 33rd degree things would be a bit different... that degree is somewhat rare and is a special award given for service.  \n",
      "As for being elected Master of a lodge, even that is not that notable... most lodges elect a new Master every year, and since there are tens of thousands of lodges in the US alone, this means that there are literally hundreds of thousands of Past Masters in the US.  In smaller lodges, it is not uncommon for every member of the lodge to have a turn as Master.  Now... if Graham had been elected Grand Master of an entire Masonic jurisdiction things would be different... state or national level Masonic office is somewhat notable (there are only hundreds and not thousands each year), and that is the level of notability that deserves categorization.\n",

This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.\n",

Another important point is that Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, so it's not supposed to include any material which is purely promotional. Even valid encyclopedic content may routinely be edited by any other editor, and understanding this point is vital for anyone who is planning to contribute anything. One cannot prohibit others from editing one's additions and no permission is needed to be able to edit content added by others. This, in fact, is one of the five pillars of Wikipedia.\n",

You'll notice, for example, that I've made a number of fixes to the style you used to format your addition to the Kaluga Oblast article—this is not because the style you used is somehow inferior, but simply because it does not conform to the style used across other articles in the series on Russian oblasts. At any rate, style matter are pretty low on the chain of importance, and as a new editor you are not expected to immediately be familiar with all nooks and crannies of Wikipedia's Manual of Style. You should not, however, be surprised when others fix it.\n",
      "Style issues aside, Wikipedia is all about content, of course. It's understandable that as someone close to the source of information you will have a lot to share, but the applicable policies to bear in mind here are those on verifiability and reliable sources. What this means in practice is that every statement which can reasonably be expected to be contested must have a source, and the source must be a reliable one, published by an organization with a reputation for checking the facts and/or with editorial oversight. Ultimately, this means that articles should be based on reliable secondary sources, and in your situation it means that sources produced by the Government of Kaluga Oblast in general and by the Agency for Regional Development in particular would most likely fall under the definition of a primary (not secondary) source. Primary sources are still perfectly acceptable to verify hard facts, but they immediately become unsuitable once judgement is passed. In other words, it's OK to to use a primary source to back up a statement that Kaluga Oblast's GRP in 2010 was 214.5 billion rubles, but a secondary source is mandatory to back up a statement like \"\"this demonstrates the oblast's high economic potential\"\".\n",
      "With formalities and general introductions taken care of, let's address your question about \"\"Kaluga Oblast\"\" somehow being a wrong translation. That actually is not the case. The term \"\"oblast\"\" is a loanword in the English language, included in all major dictionaries, and it is much more precise than a more vague \"\"region\"\", \"\"territory\"\", or \"\"province\"\". This isn't to say that any of those terms are \"\"wrong\"\"—they are not—but they are simply not as suitable for use in a reference work with such a huge scope as Wikipedia's due to their ambiguity. This issue had been discussed on several past occasions, and the general consensus is that using a more precise term is better than using a less precise one. Precision is actually one of the criteria used to select an article's title. Note also that all major English-language reference works use the term \"\"oblast\"\" (see, for example, Encyclopedia Britannica). Additionally, since the article about Kaluga Oblast is a part of the series on the Russian oblasts, its title is expected to conform to the same format as the rest of the articles. WP:NCCS is the applicable guideline covering all this, if you are interested in reviewing it.\n",

      "Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor \"\"with experience\"\". A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others. A wiki editor examines facts without judging others, as is the case in discriminatory environments. Therefore, he is not a wiki editor and is most likely a poser. He seems to be a sensitive american \"\"man\"\" who feels everyone is against him or his american way of thinking. He must understand that not everyone will like him or his background. I have also noticed that another user named, Seb, may be the same person. He's probably using dual usernames in wiki. \n",

I am not doing this as an amateur Wikipedia editor, but as the private citizen who is being 'outed' and defamed in two Wikipedia articles (so far).   I have been advised to delete the offending passage, and then wait and see who exactly restores it. That person (unless it is a SmackBot, an automatic revert), will in turn be 'outed' and 'named' as the subject of a criminal investigation.  Yes, this is a 'legal threat,' and I don't appreciate various inept Wikipedia administrators threatening me in order to dissuade me from complaining to law enforcement about a crime which is being committed: the willful invasion of privacy, and defamation of a U.S. Citizen, in contravention to numerous local, state, and federal laws, as well as in contravention to numerous strict and explicit Wikipedia policies regarding inclusion of a person's name in a Wikipedia article. The following excerpt is just one example of Wikipedia guidelines which have been willfully, persistently and openly ignored and defied by Wikipedia editor after Wikipedia editor.  Again...whoever restores the defamatory passage which includes my nameor ANY paragraph, sentence or article which includes my namewill be investigated and [hopefully] prosecuted for doing so.

There'd be columns for University, State, and NRHP name, perhaps with a \"\"type\"\" column or with color coding for NHLs vs. regular NRHPs.  All 3 or 4 columns could be sortable.  However, some of the university historic districts listed here include sublists of contributing properties.  Not sure how those would work in a sortable table.  Mere contributing properties should not be made to appear to be equivalent in appearance to a NRHP.  Perhaps it could be done as a sortable list with one row per NRHP / NHL, and those sublists could just be included as blocks appearing in a description column?   \"\n",

She says that, according to what she was told, it sells on Amazon for 50 USD/48 EUR and that she would send me a link from the Barnes&Noble; website. There are several issues here: first, both she and I don't think it's ethical to publish any kind of biography of a living person without notifying the person (and at least her business address is widely known). Secondly, and which has to do directly with Wikipedia, both she and I don't believe that one can, just like that, copy &paste; content that is made available for free and make profit out of it (how much of this book did the authors actually work for? we don't know, because we don't have it yet; but they take pride in \"\"basing\"\" it on wp which  is not a good sign).\n",

I personally think private is the more appropriate term for schools existing outside of the public system requiring yearly tuition in excess of $20,000+.

What's the explanation?  The Cabal is, obviously, trying to manipulate the encyclopedia article 'jim bell', to keep its errors and omissions from being fixed.  But that's not enough.  They want to (need to!) conceal evidence of their nefarious activites, and that includes instantly (if possible) removing critical references to their misconduct, even on the talk:jim bell page.  (And all references to their misconduct will be critical:  The Cabal ignores all objections to its manipulations, other than to delete, reverse, erase, or otherwise conceal them.)   It remains no violation of WP rules to post from an IP address, particularly if the Cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means.  The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.  (Rather than merely remaining silent.) And since most of the incorrect 'misinformation' on 'jim bell' originated from Skomorokh's edits, he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected.      71.36.117.224  \"\n",

On the other hand, the article now seems to be claiming that the death of the victim occurred before 11 pm, giving Knox and Sollecito a cast iron alibi.

But it looks like the second period of Achamenid rule, following the Thirtieth Dynasty, is sometimes called the Thirty-first Dynasty. One might count the Ptolemies as the Thirty-second Dynasty, but I don't know if any reliable sources do so. They're either called \"\"the Ptolemaic dynasty\"\" or \"\"the Ptolemies\"\" or \"\"the Lagides\"\". And counting them as number 32 instead of 33 would ignore the Argead Dynasty (Alexander the Great, his son Alexander IV of Macedon, and Philip III Arrhidaeus), which ruled briefly but probably as long as some of the minor numbered dynasties. I can't see any reason for counting the Ptolemies as number 34. Unless sources address the issue, I think attempts to give the Ptolemies a number should be left out of the article.   \"\n",

Her mother is part black! . Where is the complexity?? You want to get nitty gritty she mentions black 3 times and Puerto Rican once. That would make her 1/8th Puerto Rican if you want to go so far and that has nothing to do if it's black Puerto Rican lineage or otherwise.There's nothing complicated the only complication are you(zealot editors), who choose to use give blind allegiance to your clan members opinions  other than what is truth then turn around and hide under \"\"POV-pushing and much to-do over nothing.\"\" To get off topic a bit, Barack obama was a nigger, NOT nigga, but a Nigger up till Nov 4th or when it became apparent he was to become POTUS no.44. After that he then became mixed, then bi-racial then finally half white ,not half black mind you, but half white. Some person or persons feel very proud that this young lady has a trace of Puerto Rican lineage in her family tree and I have absolutely no objection with that naturally. But its just that,a trace, there is no need for a Puerto rican ascendancy with a link of Puerto Rican actresses and definitely no need to be stating Puerto Rican as a defining characteristic of her. It's trivial for she is far from being Puerto Rican both culturally and genetically. If anything there should be a native Amerindian link. Put the shoe on the other foot and this young lady was four shades lighter and possessed 1/8th African heritage and 'looked' Nordic. Would a link for African American actresses be up there? Would Black be mention first even if she had said it first??? You can bet your ass not! And you know it! I doubt it would even be mentioned. Matter of fact when I'm done here I'm heading over to the John Mccain page to kick up some dusk   for inclusion of his black ancestry, yes sir. And guess what else Mr.wild? I know just what you look like; WHITE. And you know what else Wildly? With your dismissive attitude I am even more certain than ever that you are very much a racist appeaser.

      "Hi, just wanted to let you know I restored a table to the Nestle-Aland page.  Not sure why you didn't notify me that you were removing it.  In any case, I found this source through a Roman Catholic, and it has an imprimatur from that church.  I've found other scholarly reviews for it as well, including a peer review from the Society of Biblical Literature.  Although I'm sure yours was a good faith edit and a simple mistake, I'm a bit concerned that you didn't ask me about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also concerned after glancing at your user contribs that you do a LOT of source deletion without discussing this with the other good faith editors that have taken time and research to provide.  Although we do need to have sources cleaned up here, we'd actually get along faster if you slow down a bit and discuss the sources with the editors who have provided them.  It's a simple courtesy, and would save us all time redoing earlier work.  It's tough writing an encyclopedia, but continuously REwriting it is even harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so you'll know, I do not add sources that I do not personally own.  I have a rather extensive library, and often purchase books for the purpose of responsibly editing on this site.  It's a rather expensive exercise and requires more time than simply deleting sources I'm not familiar with.  There have been times that I did not like a source that was listed, and bought several other sources in order to rebuild or supplement information that was insufficiently verified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, this is a slower and more expensive process than simple deletion.  I'd appreciate it if you do the same.  If you don't mind, could you let me know if you have deleted other sources I've provided on this site?  After some months away I was looking forward to adding sourced material in the field of stock technical analysis, but I'm now dreading having to go back and research any other places you may have deleted my earlier work in religious or literary subjects.  I'd appreciate any help you can give me here so I can move on to other subjects with minimal time restoring any sources that have been removed.\n",

      "Checks and Balances in the Articles for Deletion Nomination Process\n",
      "There needs to be better checks and balances in the process of how articles are currently nominated for deletion, to prevent notable topics from being deleted without actual qualification per Wikipedia article deletion guidelines. This is a significant problem, because it is very likely that notable topics are being injustly deleted. It's easy to nominate an article for deletion and then type five or six words and wait to see if an article will be deleted, whereas it takes more time to refute nominations. Perhaps there should be more sophisticated criterion to nominate articles for deletion. As it is now, anyone can nominate any article without providing a just rationale for doing so, and can instead simply base the nomination upon basic, generic and inspecific statements such as \"\"doesn't pass general notability guidelines\"\", while not specifically stating which parts of the guidelines they are supposedly referring to. If nobody comes along to correct an injust or baseless nomination, the article is then deleted based upon unqualified, general statements that don't actually correspond with the required source searching per WP:BEFORE prior to nominating an article for deletion. This definitely makes it very easy for people to censor Wikipedia, for whatever subjective reasons. Here's how it's done: an article is nominated for deletion and an AfD entry is created, a generic rationale is provided to misqualify the deletion without actually checking for reliable sources to establish topic notability. Afterward, if nobody comes along to correct the faulty nomination, the article is deleted. It's also easy for people to message one-another to delete articles, often per an \"\"as per nom\"\" rationale, while disregarding the actual notability of topics. If nobody comes along and provides an objective analysis to refute the deletion of an article in which the topic is actually notable, nominated per generic statements and without the required source searching prior to nomination, then the article disappears. Hopefully Wikipedia can introduce better checks and balances to prevent this type of easily accomplished, simple censorship. One idea is to include a requirement prior to article nomination for deletion in which the nominator has to state, or check-box on a template, that they've performed the required minimum search in Google Books and in the Google News Archive required by WP:BEFORE, and in Google Scholar for academic subjects, as suggested in WP:BEFORE. This would be a simple addition to the AfD nomination process that would add significant integrity to the process, and would also encourage users to follow the proper procedures.\n",

      "The discussion of why a nonzero EDM for the neutron violates P and T (and thus CP) is not strictly true: for a spin-1/2 particle the only axis of quantisation  and thus the only well defined direction  is proportional to its spin. Hence, we have to define the EDM d to be along that axis; the term entering the Hamiltonian is -d.E, which is T-odd and P-odd. Acting with T reverses the neutron's spin and thus d; acting with P reverses the direction of E  hence giving rise to the CP violation.

      "I've been told that you're a leading proponent of the theory that the safety of cyclists and pedestrians is best improved by getting people to use these modes of transport instead of their cars.  Like you, I think it's often necessary to force the issue by making driving so unpleasant, frustrating, delay-ridden and unsatisfying that motorists give up and use better forms of transport (no matter how inconvenient they may be).  I agree with you that extremely low speed limits rigidly enforced by camera is the best way of doing this, and I also agree with you that the rise in deaths caused in the short term by these measures is nothing compared to the millions of lives which will be saved when private motoring has been restricted to the most important people (like you and me).  Of course we have to lie and pretend that the measures are there for short-term safety, but it's necessary to do so, and society will thank us in the end.\n",

      "Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list. His work is well-regarded in 20th century philosophy, he certainly has the credentials, and I think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory, epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the \"\"data of consciousness\"\" and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see Insight: A study of Human Understanding.

I suspect that 'ponde' is cheyanne or sioux as talking to those people its their word, but Sturt may very well have made that name up and I suspect he did.  Some Sioux etc were very much in the Gundagai area but Sturt may have known the word before he went downriver.  It seems he left a ponde downriver also.  Another aussie word that is native american is 'creek'.  We do not blink at its use, ever. Sturt did record the pondebadgery word.  What pondebadgery refers to is appropriate and is in context and association, just the vowles etc do not sound to me that ponde is a Wiradjuri word.  NOTE:  I did not note that it was a wiradjuri word. I only note Wiradjuri words if they have a known ethnology.  Sturt records Warby being at Pondebadgery.  This is the g.g.granddad of Ben Warby who holds the world water speed record.  Warby does not record 'pondebadgery' nor does anyone else in all of Australia's story that I am aware of and I have looked extensively. Just Sturt does though badgery or budgeri is previously recorded.  \"\"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery\"\" is more correct than what it has been edited to as that edit seperates Sturt from the word when no one knows that at all so its factually incorrect and should not be done as its making something that was correct as it stood, into fiction.  The cod story is very correct.  I can't vouch for the use of 'ponde' in it as being of Indigneous origin, though.\"\n",

But if you look back at those student periodicals from the 1960s and up to a decade earlier, you'll see the term was widey used to refer to the large (more than a few thousand students as UVa had at the time) co-educational universities.  The bru-ha-ha about State-Uism came to a head when women were admitted in 1970... I had to read through all that stuff in the late 1990s for the \"\"History of UVa\"\" class that I think is still taught at the university.

It is fairly equivocal about the whole matter.  The Powerpoint Document gives the most convincing argument with the statement: \"\"With regard to HIV surveillance and prevention, the CDC’s current practice is not to separate MTF TG and TS people from the MSM category, with no attention paid to the risks of FTM TG people.\"\" (A noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay.)  The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as \"\"MSM\"\" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as \"\"MSTGW\"\" and not \"\"MSM\"\" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: \"\"Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as \"\"balls.\"\" These social networks include \"\"houses\"\" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000).

      "First, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order, \n",
      "\n",
      "1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).\n",
      "\n",
      "1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080\n",
      "\n",
      "They are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ag\n",

      "If using hubs there is a limit imposed by the need for a collision to be detected everywhere, iirc it's officially two hubs for fast ethernet (though in practice you may get away with more due to shorter than required delays in the hubs) but hardly anyone uses hubs anymore so this is largely irrelevent in modern network design. Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn't a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols.\n",
      "Practically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will \"\"fail open\"\" and end up broadcasting traffic they don't know where to send to the whole network. Furthermore being a tree network a lot of traffic will tend to cluster on the center of the tree (the impact of this can be reduced by making those parts of the network higher speed or by using techniques like port trunking).\"\n",

There are some sources here that support the idea that various types of nuclear power have been considered as sustainable, but that wasn't the only reason the IPs edits were reverted. This is one reason tying this into the above discussion is a bad idea, because this isn't just about the academic consensus on a loosely defined \"\"type of nuclear fission\"\". Using the article to explain in context that nuclear power is in some ways sustainable, according to some points of view, would be fine. The edits introduced large quantities relatively weakly sourced material to present nuclear as being a primary and uncontroversial source of sustainable energy. The above sources support mentioning nuclear as one aspect of sustainability. They do not warrant altering the article to make nuclear energy the first specific section, nor do they warrant excessive ref-bombing to support that perspective, while using similarly selective tactics to undermine those who hold a more critical perspective. This isn't just about verifiability, this is also about WP:WEIGHT. Even the sources presented here indicate that nuclear's sustainability is under-researched and hinges on too many unknowns to be accepted without further comment. This is true for many areas of sustainable energy research, but especially nuclear. It is an active area of research (or areas, rather) which has a relatively small but extremely vocal core of active supporters. This should not be used to diminish that perspective or the potentially revolutionary research, but major context was being selectively left-out from the proposed edits.   \"\n",

If one of the reasons for AM404 being an analgetic was TRPV1 activation, it would have to be the opposite to that of capsaicine. The only wat in which TRPV1 agonism would decrease pain is that a prolonged exposure to high doses of the agonist decreases the sensitivity, which is the case in any type of receptor activation, but this would mean that AM404 is no more an analgetic than capsaicine or any other source of pain... and the relief would come after a period of pain actually getting worse.\n",

      "If this is roughly accurate, then the number of active admins is probably around 300 or less. (I don't know how many total editors were active in the last 30 days). While some admins involve themselves in setting policies (which anyone may participate in), others seem to confine themselves to truly janitorial work. For that reason I'm not sure if \"\"bureaucracy\"\" is the best way to describe the corps of admins, or the dangers threatened by their expansion. The more plausible fear, I think, is that too many admins will result in a \"\"police state\"\", with more sped-up deletes, heavy-handed blocks, and POV enforcement. I am certainly opposed to any movement in the direction of stifling unpopular POVs. I'm not sure that the number of admins is the major factor though. Another view, which I don't endorse either, is that having more admins broadens involvement and reduces the relative power of any one admin. I think that the most important issues are probably the rules and procedures, official and unofficial, that admins follow and/or enforce on others, Those powers should stay limited. - 05:26, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)\n",

      "né: John Herb Miller (he used the form: J. Herb Miller) \n",
      "b. 1915, d. 1987. Age: 72 (Stroke) \n",
      "Overview \n",
      "Herb Miller, Glenn Miller's younger brother, was born in North Platte, Nebraska, and, like Glenn, studied music in High School. Herb worked his way through college by playing the trumpet. He spent a short spell working in his brother's band, doubling as trumpeter and also as business manager. Herb then accepted an offer to play trumpet with Charlie Spivak. Herb did have a band of his own in the early 1940s. In 1943, he and his band appeared in a movie called \"\"Spotlight Scandals,\"\" starring Harry Langdon (about a year before he died), and featuring singer Bonnie Baker. William Beaudine was the director. Late in the 1950s, Herb formed his band and toured the U.S. with appearances in hotels and ballrooms, including the Aragon Ballroom in Ocean Park, CA, the Jerry Jones Ballroom, and the Rendezvous Ballroom in Salt Lake City, UT. Yet, despite Herb's best efforts, the band only met with moderate success. The only album cut by the band, in America, was on Herb's own label, Millertone. While Herb's band never came even remotely close to the fame that his older brother Glenn achieved, it is still active and quite popular in England today (1999). After WWII, Herb settled in Pacific Grove, California, and made that his home base for about 25 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Lovejoy, a former student of Herb's and onetime member of his band, recalls: \n",
      "\"\"Herb didn't form his band while his brother was alive, and not until many years after his brother's death. He was so devastated by his brother's disappearance that he got out of the commercial music business and moved to Pacific Grove, where he got a job as an elementary and junior high school music teacher in the Pacific Grove Unified School District. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"I first met Herb when I was in fourth grade and became a beginning trumpet student of his. Herb's son, John, ( -John Arthur Miller, who today still leads the Herb Miller Orchestra in England), was my best friend in grammar school. Herb was a very talented music teacher, gruff but fair, and the kids all loved him. He also was the leader of the Monterey Civic Band, to which most of us Herb Miller Orchestra members belonged. (NB: Mr Lovejoy has advised that circa 2002, the orchestra was re-named the \"\"John Miller Orchestra\"\".) \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Herb, for some reason, decided in the late 1950s to form his own band, and his own children were a part of it. John (known as 'Jackson') played bass and sang; Mary Luann, his eldest daughter, who went by 'Luann', also sang and played piano; Richard 'Richie' Miller, his younger son, played trumpet; and Janet, or 'Jannie,' his youngest child, sang. His wife, Ann, was band manager. Some of the rest of us were his former students who were still in high school or had recently graduated; other members were area teachers. One of his trumpet players, Tony Venza (whose playing sounded like Harry James), drove a moving van for a living. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Initially, Herb was quite ambivalent about using his brother's fame to boost his own image. He actually used to claim that his band and Glenn's were not at all alike. But, in fact, they were almost identical. Herb looked and talked like Glenn ('And now, something a little old, new, borrowed and blue...'), although he was shorter in stature. He played Glenn's most famous songs, and his own arrangements sounded just like Glenn's. The only difference was that he used only two trombones instead of four, as Glenn did. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The first record Herb made was called 'First Steps Of A New Miller' on the Millertone label. It was a failure, of course, since he paid for it out of his own pocket, and distribution was limited. And, of course, even in the 1950s-'60s, his music was dated. He thought it was because of rock and roll, which he fervently believed was a communist plot. He reasoned that the communists introduced rock and roll into American culture in order to put 'legitimate' musicians out of work and thereby ruin the American economy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Herb had a few other idiosyncrasies, too. For instance, when people found out he was Glenn's brother, they would inevitably mention Glenn's death. Herb would explode, 'Glenn's not dead! Don't ever say that again!' Later, a few years after he'd started his own band, he seemed to have accepted his brother's death. That's when he started drinking and when he started trading on his brother's name. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"After moving to England, he really went overboard on comparing himself to Glenn. He even had a poster made up with him posing exactly like the famous picture of Glenn, holding a trombone and looking over his shoulder. This was kind of strange because Herb's main instrument was the trumpet. \n",

See Spin-off (media)#In video games. Spinoff typically refers to something, made later, that takes an element of the original product and expands upon it by adding new original content to it. Angel is a spinoff of Buffy, retaining the characters Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley, and the general setting of the Buffyverse, and adding several new characters, a new setting (L.A.), and a largely unrelated plot. The Sims could be considered a spinoff of Simcity, but The Sims 2 (console game) is not a spinoff of The Sims 2.  (talk|Contribs) \"\n",

      "It is true that geological studies show changes of the environment that contradicts the strong Gaia hypothesis of ecosystems working towards an optimum state. It is also true that there is evidence that ecosystems have collapsed from within. However, the frequency of such ecosystem collapses through geological history is many orders of magnitude lower than the extremely high frequency predicted by the Malthusian model of maximum reproduction. So evolution must be driven by something other than maximization of reproduction. The selfish gene model (the theoretical mechanism basis of the Medea hypothesis of life destroying itself) appears to be supported by simple computer simulations, but so does strong Gaia hypothesis. The strong Gaia hypothesis failed scale-up to more complex systems, and the missing frequency of Medean ecosystem collapses can be explained if the selfish gene model also fails scale-up to the greater complexity of real life because real life is too complex to be livable to such rigid, unselfcritical entities as the selfish gene model claims that living organisms are. In other words, the selfish gene model is based on the same methodological error as is the strong Gaia hypothesis. This is explained in greater detail on the pages \"\"Moderating the Gaia/Medea debate\"\" and \"\"Self-organization\"\" on Pure science Wiki, a wiki devoted to the scientific method unaffected by academic prestige obsession.\n",

lol good luck with that you're not getting that out of me...i mean i'm willing to compromise and discuss things but you are putting half-assed edits..i'm filling them out an expanding and putting sources on them i might add and you or others with your limited mentality revert an article to 1 with very little information ..how are empty spaces better than filled ones? that makes absolutely no sense...i even provide some sources from where i get my stuff from and still complain n harass?...you prob didn't even notice some of the edits there you see in even your edits and others  were done by ME lol, you just built upon it and added your own, i'm not saying you nor others taking credit for others work and research (i hope not that's just unprofessional and messed up) but you got something of a personal motive that you're not admitting to, if i'm doing the edits as best as i can and doing it the same way as you are and tryign to provide sources...what s the problem then? the stuff i get my info from are from credited  1st or 3rd party websites lol..what more do you need? the signatures of the editors of the other websites where i get my info from? come on now haha..why don't you be a little more honest and say what really is your problem with me instead of making escuses for it and when people confront you about it or want to speak their mind you back out...oh yeah that's very mature pal just because i don't believe in the same ideals as you ...i mean how can  an admin of such  \"\"REPUTATION\"\" be so naive..i don't get it..you don't like others to express their disapproval or speak their mind about how to improve an article  i mean this is what U r doing \"\"4 + X = 5\"\"..that's ok to you right ..missing information that you won't even bother to look up fully and this isn't a grammar class people make typos all the time big deal deal with it..this isn't a regular article its a talk page. i got my say as much as you do regardless of how long you have being editing here or your position here etc, i have a say as much as you do...if you can't take criticism of your poorly edited works than maybe you shouldn't be editing here in the first place..you have no seniority or control over me whatsoever..no one does as i don't have over you ...all i'm asking is for me do do things right and i'am i give u sources , i flesh out the articles n fill in the blanks ..what more do you want guy?...don't make arrogant excuses about my typos or so called ramblings just because you can't take being told in your face criticism in your work...the point is i COMPLETE the articles..you and others with your mentality don't finish it or bother to do a more thorough look..so don't make excuses for your wrong doings ..so you can't take criticism, you don't like other people's edits that re more complete and informative than yours unless you are the 1 editing them, you make excuses for people speaking their mind when they tell you things in your face that are mostly true but you aren't mature enough to own up to it, you make it personal...so if you or anyone who thinks like you don't think about it or made the effort than its BAD right? lol...who you think you are? god ? lol ....i try to be respectful and i want to be able to edit freely in my own way even though my versions are usually more complete , informative and thorough, i don't make up facts i don't troll or do things with bad intentions here..especially here because i rely in wikipedia  myself when i want to look up something just because you haven't thought it up or made the effort to be more thorough doesn't mean you or your kind with your mindset have to abuse their authority here because they weren't creative enough to come up wit h it themselves..like i said go ahead and make excuses about misspellings and ramblings because you hide under that to mask your own faults wish it was you who done it and thought it up\n",

Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled \"\"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'\"\"[7]\n",

      "Er, no. Nice try (I'm being kind) but do you really believe that portraying a £720,000 EU grant for researching new ways of thickening several food products, including yoghurt, as \"\"£700,000 to stop yoghurt going runny\"\" is as much of a misrepresentation as the way you mischaracterised Britain's 1939 declaration of war? No, of course you don't. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that anyone can think of the yoghurt thing (and many other examples) as being any kind of misrepresentation, but the Commission certainly does, else such stories wouldn't be on its many lists of \"\"myths\"\", so I have to assume that you and other Wikipedians are being sincere when you see misrepresentation where I see only (justifiable) disrespect and ingratitude.\n",

The current article starts with a lot of tosh about urban legendsby stating that \"\"Euromyths can be either wholly untrue or a deliberate distortion of the facts\"\".

To put it simply, any examination of any official list of Euromyths will throw up at least one Euromyth that is to myth, falsehood and misrepresentation what Plan D was to  democarcy, dialogue and debatenot mythical at all.\n",

As to the content of the SeaWorld article itself, it needs work ... no question. Clean out the marketing spin and focus on SeaWorld's history prior to its acquisition by Anheuser-Busch (at which point it became part of Busch Entertainment Corporation, which is now SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). As to \"\"favorable vs. unfavorable,\"\" if that's truly how I felt, such incidents articles wouldn't exist. I've gone through with SpikeJones and other editors to keep everything consistent, first getting involved with them after the monorail accident in July 2009, when this exact same issue came up, and again consensus was that leaving out the victim's name didn't damage the article, nor did it add any significant value to it (at which point, tie goes to \"\"leave it out\"\"). After that, it was the rash of lewd-behavior incidents at Central Florida water parks ... again, if I was trying to protect the parks, I wouldn't have allowed the information in, as if it were completely up to me, anyway. Heck, I added a number of them into their respective articles, and I fleshed out others with more details and more source information to back it all up! (In the interest of full disclosure, the victims in those incidents were generally minors, which (a) wouldn't have been named by the news and (b) if some unscrupulous person had gotten a hold of the names, I have no doubt the names would be expunged immediately and nobody who really had the project's best interests at heart would put up a fight.

My support is the primary definition of religion offered by Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary: \"\"the service and worship of God or the supernatural\"\". (I call this the \"\"primary definition\"\", though it does follow a highly technical one: \"\"the state of a religious\"\". Here is the example given for that usage: \"\"a nun in her 20th year of religion\"\".) Here's more support: Our Pew Research source brackets atheists with those \"\"unaffiliated\"\" with a religious faith. And here's even more support: Our CUNY Graduate Center source brackets atheists with those identifying with \"\"No religion group\"\". All clear?   \"\n",

Although I think the underlying point is that the quote section has heretofore been used as kind of a dumping ground for Ann's more outrageous quotes in what appears to be an attempt to confirm her detractors portrait of her as an out of control nut-case. So, if I had to come down on this tiny controversy, I'd say either remove all the quotes to WikiQuote or simply add some quotes that seem more trenchant and insightful to counter the obvious attempt at caricature.

      "\n",
      "First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.  \"\n",

Early on the Army decided that it was cost-prohibitive to maintain whole herds, so they used the remount stations to house selected stallions and then contracted out with local horse breeders to provide mares. Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized (after World War I), but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West. One thing the remount service is credited with (as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 20-25 years) was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service. This was because the Army didn't (and couldn't) buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didn't meet standards or were otherwise unneeded.\n",

If you only include Y-DNA study but not the mtDNA study you  might aswell remove the claim Ainu are haplogroup D2 and blame it on the genetic drift. Many people are asking what is the origin mtDNA of the Ainu, and the study I provided answers that question even though it clearly says it's an hypothesis it's still far better than nothing. The genetic study I provided \"\" Mitochondrial DNA analysis of Jomon skeletons from the Funadomari\"\" revealed excellent information on ancient Jomon skeleton before the migrations of the Yayoi skeleton.

You have to change this attitude on your part. Your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus, even if it is demonstrably wrong!!!! In my experience david is absolutely right in what he says. You guys are of course wrong. You prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism. That is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated. Every day I find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia. I think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that I can determine.

      "One of the most difficult questions facing the right to life concerns the precise definition of the term ‘human life’- when exactly does ‘life’ begin and end? This controversial issue has its focus with the exact point of the commencement of human life. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it would be accorded the ‘right to life’ under the constitution. Thus, laws concerning abortion would effectively be rendered unconstitutional.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Singapore, the Penal Code lays out the sanctions imposed if one does not comply with the Termination of Pregnancy Act- which limits abortion to patients who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. In Malaysia, the Penal Code states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception, only if the pregnancy were to pose a threat to an expecting mother’s physical or mental health.  This shows that in these two jurisdictions, the states are unwilling to confer the ‘right to life’ to fetuses younger than the stipulated periods. The legislation there has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expecting mothers who are threatened by their unborn child, and made provisions for their survival.[FIND YOUR JOURNAL^^]\n",
      "\n",
      "This is in contrast with the approach taken in other modern jurisdictions, such as the Philippines, which provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception. The Czech Republic also states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. It is notable that the latter two jurisdictions have a predominatly Catholic majority, who are staunchly pro-life. Therefore, chances of a  universal concensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.[PROF**]\n",

However, in looking at the CNN article, I noticed that in the beginning (fourth paragraph down) the following statement appears: \"\"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. On the other hand, the academic literature (i.e., peer-reviewed, scholarly journals) is full of articles addressing CNN's bias. They have concluded that the public perceives CNN to have a liberal bias:\n",

Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”) \n",
      ">Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”) \n",

      "London Borough Parks Constabularies are, as is correctly quoted, established under sec 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provision Order Confirmation 1967.  This act allows London borough councils to establish a body of constables who have the power to enforce parks bye-laws in their respective parks.  It does not make these constables ‘police constables’ and does not allow police services or forces to be established.  No police powers are given to these parks constables (with the exception of parks bye laws) over and above those which everybody is entitled, often referred to as ‘any person’ powers or as in the case of arrest, ‘citizen’s arrest’.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In comparison, officers from Home Office forces (such as the Met, Kent Police etc) can point to the Police Act 1996 as the basis for their establishment, jurisdiction and powers as police constables.  BTP officers can point to the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.  Ministry of Defence Police officer can point to the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1986.  I could go on…My point is that all these police forces have a legal basis and with the attached powers to call themselves police officers and the organisations they work for police services/forces.  The WPP does not, unless someone can point to a piece of legislation that I have missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the article started by saying, “Wandsworth Parks Police is a Police Service successfully run…”.  Two points about the opening sentence.  Firstly, its NOT legally a police service but a borough parks constabulary.  Secondly, the comment regarding ‘successfully run’ is highly subjective and without basis.  All organisations would like to be thought of a successful, but without any citation it should not be in an encyclopaedic article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under legal status the paragraph starts by mentioning the Met and working closely with it.  Irrelevant to legal status me thinks and again subjective.  Why mention a home office force in the legal status paragraph of a parks constabulary.  This paragraph should merely be about the legal status of WPP and its constables.  The paragraph rightly states that a magistrate swears WPP constables in, but not as ‘police constables’ but as ‘parks constables’ due to the legislation involved.  Once sworn in the parks constables have executive powers to enforce parks bye-laws in their boroughs ONLY.  Criminal law is not included.  However, just like the general public, parks constables can enforce criminal law in certain limited circumstances relating to indictable offences only.  This is commonly known as ‘citizens arrest’.  Due to changes in arrest powers with SOCAP in 2006, non police officers, such as parks constables need to be aware of the necessity criteria to make an arrest lawful.  My point is that the article read like the parks constables had police powers – they don’t (apart from the bye law aspect).  The paragraph then goes on to state that parks constables come under PACE.  Well this is obvious and irrelevant, any arrest by anyone is under PACE (as amended by SOCAP).  What it doesn’t do is give parks constables any more power than Joe Public (apart from the bye law aspect).  For all the above reasons, the last sentence of this paragraph (“They are always Parks Police Officers regardless of the technicalities of whether or not they are in the act of enforcing bye-laws.”) is not a true reflection of law and quite frankly wrong and misleading.  There is no such thing as a parks ‘police officer’. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had added at the bottom of the article two paragraphs with cited evidence which brings into question the status of parks constabularies and their use of the word ‘police’, blue lights and use of batons etc.  These were deleted without reason.  They are legitimate sources which shed light on the grey area.  You may not agree with the report and committee’s results but they are in the public domain and support my contention that there IS a grey area and WPP are treading on thin ice on occasion.\n",

I remember seeing 100% power aft and in the 90's forward: (The aft plant always drew more power at high speed due to the center screws taking more power). At this max allowed peacetime power the ship did do over thirty knots, (but not much)the increase in power required to gain even a few knots was immense. Even if the battle short switches were on (over-riding all reactor protective functions) the plants just plain could not make enough power to go a whole lot faster.

      "Dougweller, Okay, I can see that you're not going to respect my wish. The \"\"attacking\"\" was done by SamEV. (Whether you're ever going to admit it or not.) As mentioned above, he claimed that the Italian unification gave Italy a king, not a president. I proved to him that the unification gave Italy both. He further claimed that Spain ruled Naples, Sicily and Sardinia during Columbus's time, and he sent me about five Wikipedia articles that he said would prove it. (And called me ignorant!) I did not care to look at his articles, as he might have changed them deliberately for his own self-serving needs. So, instead, I went to Wikipedia's \"\"Italian Renaissance\"\" article, and I found it stated that during the Middle Ages (1300-1499), Naples, Sicily and Sadinia were ruled by the Arabs and the Normans. This seemed more on the right track to me. On Monday, I borrowed a book about the Italian Rennaisance from my local library. In truth, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia were governed mostly by the Arabs and the Normans during this time. Spain was involed in it with the Normans. The Norman kings and queens were marrying Spanish kings and queens, in these parts of Italy, and future rulers included second and third generation nobles who were born on the Italian peninsula. All said, Spain had a bit to do with these parts of Italy at that time. It's generally accepted that the lion's share of it all belongs to the Arabs and the Normans. SamEV's gross exaggeration about Spain ruling these areas, at that time, is a sad reminder that people who edit on Wikipedia are not always using the exact truth. Now, regarding SamEV's attacks. I was raised, in what I believe, is the correct way. The majority of people agree, that calling someone \"\"ignorant\"\" is offensive and insulting. (Dictionaries often point this out.) Unfortunately, there exists a minority of people, who, with mean-spirited intention, will call people such names, and, then, hide behind a false angelic face of well-meant wisdom. I don't buy this type of mentality! SamEV, says above that \"\"it's no crime to be ignorant\"\". Well, he, himself, was ignorant when it came to some Italian matters on this website. I wonder how long it takes to become a \"\"rookie\"\", like SamEV, himself, on Wikipedia. Pertaining to the vernacular...I'm not interested in slang (or attempts to verify it)! In the future, I, like many people, will prefer to go to the library and search for a good book on the topic I happen to be interested in. This website has that \"\"too many cooks spoiling the soup\"\" feel to it, and in most cases, the articles are not accurrate. The librarian, I spoke to on Monday, had this to say: \"\"Oh, Wikipedia? It's a joke!\"\" 'Nuff said!\"\n",

Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will continue helping to improve Wikipedia.

Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted.

If the page is deleted, you can contact one of these administrators to request that the administrator userfy the page or email a copy to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

So we have hoards of people making decisions about popular cultural articles... articles which attract readers to our pages (My kids and their friends usually check things first or nearly so here, when looking something up... we should celebrate that cultural link, not kill it off!) when they don't have the first clue as to how hard it is to get published, much less hit fiftyith on the NYT best sellers or some such list. And so forth. Charmed articles are unnotable because they reached only 4-6 million households the eight years the series ran... when a publisher is delighted selling 100,000 copies!

      "It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be\n",

So, if the Pope were editing the article on the Catholic Church, wouldn't his statements have full authority and accuracy as long as it's about matters of faith?

      "Okay, that makes sense, but doesn't it go against the original way Fischer wanted to modify Chess960?  In original Chess, I have the option to either castle king-side or queen-side when there are only Rooks and King on the back rank.  But now, if I have this start position of 946 or 947, I have to move a rook.  Are there official rules out there by FIDE or USCF that explain what to do here?  If we are to be faithful to the original Chess setup, then castling must be allowed either way I would think.  Instead, we now have to move a rook away in order to castle queen-side, and it's only for roughly 2 (maybe more?) initial setups.  I think what you said should be explained in a new subsection of the castling rules.  Like, in original chess, I have people argue about En Passant, and I have an official place I can point to and tell them that En Passant is a real move.  Now if 946 or 947 arise, they may either try to do a null move, or they may force me to move a rook (if a null move is allowed).  This seems like either a flaw or something that should be outlined in the rules specifically.  If it is the case where the rook must move first, then I think a new subsection should be added to explain this. )\n",

      "I have only just noticed that you are changing the names from common to scientific because you are starting to do the Australian snakes (all of which I am watching). You do have a good argument, although I do not fully agree. The problem is that you are not going about it the wrong way. Since it is policy, you should be first trying to change the policy before mass changes to the encyclopadia. The policies are there to create consistency. All you are doing now is making it more confusing. People expect to find the common names on Wikipedia, because that is the way it is done at the moment. Also, it seems you haven't read the Tree of Life guidelines properly. In it, it says that common names should be used where there are formal common names (such as birds) or there is a relatively unique common name. Otherwise use the scientific names. For example: White's Tree Frog is unique, and therefore the common name should be used. However, if you look at Litoria chloris, the common name cannot be used. Its common name, the Red-eyed Tree Frog has a disambigous page, explaining why that common cannot be used, and states that Red-eyed Tree Frog is not unique. \n",
      "The entire issue is trying to account for the most ammount of people. If someone wants information on a snake, writes its common name into the search box, and comes across an article with a strange latin name, they may be off-put and think they wrote the wrong name, and it redirected to the wrong place. Especially if the article did not have a photo. If a scientist wants to look at an article, and puts in the scientific name, and it is redirected to the common name, they will be aware of what the common name is. In fact, you will find that in most scientific papers, they will use the common name, stating the scientific name once in brackets so their is no ambiguity. A lot of articles use the scientific name because their is no common name. There is no other choice, and there is no problem with this. \n",
      "Please, bring this up on WP:TOL talk page before changing any more articles. You cannot create consistency yourself, and all you are doing is making it worse. If policy is changed other people can help, and it is possible to get all the articles changed. Policy needs to be followed, otherwise the encyclopaedia becomes a jamble. Thankyou.\n",

      "Likewise, Catt's \"\"electromagnetism\"\" does not pass muster. \"\"Displacement Current (and how to get rid of it)\"\" throws up quite enough problems. Reading it critically reveals that although the article makes assertions about displacement current, the only \"\"real science\"\" is does is to model the voltage at the source end of a transmission line as it is charged through a resistor. Since \"\"displacement current\"\" is the prediction that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field, the only way to disprove the concept is to disprove the existence of the effect. Catt et al didn't even try to do this. It would appear that they think that because they can get to the end of the calculation without introducing \"\"displacement current\"\" that they can say that it doesn't exist. They are in total denial of the fact that their mathematics works because it has the equations that describe a capacitor built into it. Catt has quoted Davidson as (in effect) calling the Telegrapher's Equations \"\"absurd\"\" because they model a TL as a capacitor, when Catt & Davidson know that a capacitor is a TL. [Electromagnetics ch6]. Although Catt would undoubtedly claim that the equations describing the TL are based on experiment they are, in fact, derived from the Telegrapher's Equations in the first place.

I think most of the \"\"ZipLocal, inc\"\" article is incorporated in the \"\"User:Misterkellas/ZipLocal\"\" article.  The only part that's missing is the two paragraphs about how the judgement against the company played out.  But that was seven years before Tamec was renamed Zip411 then bought by redCity, then that company was renamed Ziplocal, then that company was bought out, then that company was bought out and in the meantime a completely new company renamed itself Ziplocal then traded stock in exchange for the US parts of the yellow page search information.  I think the financial ramifications of the Corporate Bureau's proceedings were minor enough that trying to dump in two paragraphs about stuff that basically happened to some other company a decade ago would sort of be a major digression from the rest of the article.  That's my opinion  I have absolutely no connection to this Ziplocal company, though, so whatever you want to do with it.

By 1905, Levavasseur had produced a water-cooled engine with eight-cylinders arranged in a 90-degree \"\"V\"\" and with direct fuel injection. It was safe, strong, and fairly powerful, generating 50 horsepower (37 kilowatts) and weighing about 110 pounds (50 kilograms). Its power-to-weight ratio was not surpassed for 25 years\n",

The motor was of advanced design, utilizing direct fuel injection and evaporative steam cooling - which took place in long tubes fixed along the sides of the fuselage. \n",

      "Hello anonymous user, in this edit (11 June 2014), you removed the name Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, from the synonymy of Mosasaurus, stating in the summary that Drepanodon is a synonym of the cave bear. You did not mention a source for this, and you might be right, but first of all, you did not show you realized there are two taxa named Drepanodon. The first one is Drepanodon Nesti, 1826, which was classified as a member of the Felidae when published; the second one is the junior homonym Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, the one that is listed in the synonymy of Mosasaurus. As you did not mention any justification for your edit, I restored the name Drepanodon Leidy to the synonymy of Mosasaurus. An extra reason for me to do this, was that it would be far more likely for the older name, given to the remains of a carnivore, to apparently represent another species of carnivore, than it would be for a name given to saurian remains. Confusion of the names was what most likely happened here, as far as I can see.\n",

      "In the same edit, you removed the name M. copeanus Marsh, 1869, from the list of invalid or dubious species, because the name had been synonymized with Plioplatecarpus depressus. The idea of this list is to summarize names that have been associated with the generic name Mosasaurus, but are no longer recognized as valid species in that genus. If such a name is eventually synonymized with a taxon in another genus, then just removing it from the list is removing information. On the other hand, adding the name for which it is now considered a synonym gives extra information. Especially if someone stumbles upon a name in Mosasaurus somewhere, and wants to find out more about it, and so decides to look up Mosasaurus in the encyclopedia, it would be most helpful when the accepted name is provided.\n",

Every time some energy is transported away from a system, the system loses mass according to E=mc²  in most cases an unmeasurable low amount. Also if you temporarily attach strings to the oppositely charged bodies, you can extract mechanical energy while reducing their distance, exactly that amount of mass will be lost (If we keep the system isolated, its total mass stays the same, e.g when letting the two bodys clonking together, the energy will first be converted to kinectic energy, then to heat, and both contribute to the mass of the system, which in effect stays constant). But in a motor the movement is periodic, so there is nothing in sight which can result in mass loss  unless some copper atoms are vanishing mysteriously or sort of transmutate into something other than normal copper.\n",

Natural selection, the most important of these, works because some traits or collections of traits will, on average, increase reproductive success, either by protecting the organism from dying before it can reproduce, or by enhancing his reproductive success directly, such as the peacock's plumage. As genes are passed on by reproduction, those that increase reproductive success are more likely to be passed on, relative to neutral or relatively unfavourable traits, and so, generation to generation, the number of organisms with these traits will tend to increase, unless conditions change so as to make them no longer favourable. Other, less important mechanisms of change include gentic drift (random changes in frequency of traits, most important when the traits are, at that time, reproductively neutral), and the founder effect, in which, if a small group of organisms become isolated from the main population, that isolated population will, even many generations on, tend to have a higher frequency of any rare variations in the founders as compared to the original, larger population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, the accumulation of many of these inherited changes can result in the development of new species from existing ones,  a process called speciation. [Explain major routes of speciation: geographical differences, isolation, divergence into seperate niches, etc]\n",
      "\n",
      "[Simple evidence, probably the Universal genetic code] and other discoveries have shown that this mechanism can be traced back to a single common ancestor, from which all living organisms on Earth descended as a result of cumulative evolutionary change over billions of years, making evolution responsible for the vast diversity of life on Earth, including the many extinct species found in the fossil record.\n",

In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points.  The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source)\n",

      "Okay, I disagree with this just as strongly as I disagree with attempts to say he wasn't Jewish.  Firstly, Marx didn't kill anybody, nor did his ideology.  A bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people.  And given that the German people managed to produce some unquestionably German people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people, I'm not going to weep for the fact that the Germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century.  Beyond that, Marx was born and grew up in Germany with a very limited connection to his Jewish ancestry.  His primary language was German, and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works.  Although he spent most of his later life in England, I've never really heard that he didn't always consider himself to be a German - I'd think, in fact, that living in England would have accentuated that.  While I do think that his Jewish background is important, and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a Jew, his German background was substantially more important than his Jewish one.  His own works emerged out of post-Hegelian debates within the German philosophical community, and his greatest influence throughout his life (and for several decades afterwards) was in Germany, where Marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of Europe (Britain, France, and Russia, in particular, had their own, non-Marxist, socialist traditions that were not assimilated into Marxism for a long time, if ever).  Marx was German of Jewish descent.  Being an \"\"internationalist\"\" is a statement of intentions for the future of the world, not of present day identity.   \"\n",

      "DICTATORSHIP OR DEMOCRACY - It's an excellent point to say that it's pointless and misleading to demonise Barnes. Clearly, there was a qualitative change in the politics of the SWP during the 1980s. Barnes clearly played a leading role in this process, but had the national committee majority behind him. Most would also say that the SWP organisational and democratic norms changed: those who were expelled, such as the Fourth International Tendency, argued it was done undemocratically and wrong-headedly.\n",
      "BREAKING WITH TROTSKYISM - This seems a fair description of the SWP's evolution. However, if the SWP feel it unfair, it would be better to write of a \"\"break with Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution and the struggle to build the Fourth International.\"\" In so far as Trotsky agrees with the Leninism, and opposition to Stalinism and the third period, the SWP agree with him. However, Trotskyism clearly refers to the politics of the movement that Trotsky and the SWP founded: the FI. The defining aspects of that movement: permanent revolution in the developing world; anti-bureaucratic revolution in the workers' states and the notion of socialist democracy. Of course, the SWP no longer calls itself Trotskyist and the word is dropped, for example, from the title of Joseph Hansen's book on Cuba.\n",
      "CASTROISM - Similary, it is mistaken to call the SWP a Castoist party. The SWP's 'New International' strategy in the 1980s and 1990s was one of convergence with the Castroist current. However, it's clear that the SWP has its own ideology.\n",

Your added text is quite verbose and uses a lot of direct speech without adding much additional information. Note that this section is dealing with Sellers' personality and his struggles in very general way, and magnifying a small event like this gives it undue weight.

I completely restructured this article to be more in line with the common Wikipedia structure used for other television programs.  Most notably The Simpsons and M*A*S*H (TV series) were used as examples of shows that were very popular and well organized.  I attempted to use logic in the categries and their order.  This reorganization was definitely needed, but it meant a lot of the content had to be moved around but I did not remove any content (yet) (except for correcting the episode of The Danny Thomas Show as being the pilot.  It was the basis for the a new show, possibly categoried as a spin-off, but it wasn't a pilot episode of TAGS).  \n",

I did not want to change too much all at once.

      "Yeah, it looks a lot better.  Just prior to its restructuring, I added a bunch of stuff to fill out the article, because it seemed a little light (for as popular a show as it is), and also simply because the Sheriff Andy Taylor link redirects here, but there was very little content about the character on this page.  But I didn't know where to put anything, so I just kind of stuck stuff here and there.  I hope I didn't add any duplicate information.

Noticing this I decided correct the problem by moving the article to include the word \"\"The\"\" in the title, and I later planned on correcting the link on the main show's article.

      "Here is a prediction that may be off topic.  Wikipedia may survive being wrong once in a while, and many of the potitcal pages have off the cuff quoted remarks, reported in the press that “He/She is the dumbest” person alive – but what will do Wikipedia, Digg, and has done the blogs in has been groups of extremeists promiting one point of view.   Once Wikipedia acquires the reputation of having sections being dominated by racists, sexists, it’s over.  Not to mention what is going to happen when it’s known that men who don’t believe date rape should be a crime can influnce Wikipedia just as they dominate the blogs – by speaking up because they are the only people who care. - unsigned\n",

      "BritishWatcher: Thanks for your courteous and transparent question (the first I have seen from the UK clique since I got \"\"involved\"\").  I'll address your second point.  If my answer to that is not clear, there is little point taking the time to suggest actual changes.  Your clarifying question mentions the premise that each part of the UK has its own subdivisions.  The article states this, but your phrasing implies that the parts are not themselves subdivisions.  The article says nothing about that.  Besides the lack of clarity on that point (assuming your reading is correct), there is another confusion in the article: I think the majority of the people reading this article will understand that the four countries are the focus of the article and that the title of the article (Subdivisions...) refers to them.  If it is the case that the parts are not themselves subdivisions, then the article is far from clear on this point (except to the three or four who have been \"\"involved\"\").  Hence, there are two confusions in the article: 1) the title suggests that the parts are subdivisions (because of the structure and general content of the article) and 2) since the article explicitly divides the UK into the four countries, this suggests that the parts are themselves subdivisions.  Your reading suggests that the title of the article should be \"\"subdivisions of the four parts of UK\"\", not \"\"subdivisions of the UK\"\".  Until these confusions are addresses, I think the article casts more shadow than light on the subject.   \"\n",

      "Wow! It has been over a year since I have posted anything here on Wikipedia and for that I am truly sorry! No, I am not dead nor is my lovely Packard Bell Legend 140CDT Supreme. I have been very busy and just have not had much time for play, only work. All work and no play makes owning a computer a bit dull so I have decided to make a dedication to posting here more often to help enhance the Wikipedia community's knowledge of Packard Bell and what good computer systems they really are. I am getting very excited as Thanksgiving is just right around the corner. Normally I post every year on Thanksgiving but last year, I did not get the chance to do so. Things will be different this year, I promise that! Thanksgiving would have to be my very favorite holiday of all time. I just feel so thankful to have such a great family and a great computer. 15 years later, my Packard Bell runs just as good as the day I bought it back in September of 1995! I recently had to upgrade my Internet browser from Microsft Internet Explorer version 5 to Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5! I was having trouble as certian websites would not view correctly in Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5. Many of my favorite websites came out too distorted to even use correctly so I am very grateful that Microsft supports up to Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 on Microsoft Windows 95 as I will never upgrade my operating system! Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 works much better and for that I am truly grateful! People must understand that Packard Bell computers are the best around, no questions asked! I plan to continue running my Packard Bell Legend 140CDT Supreme until either I die or my computer dies, wichever comes first. I look forward to spending more time here serving the Wikipedia community and want to let everyone know that I am sorry and will make a commitment to be around more to spread the word about how good Packard Bell is! God bless you all and may the force be with you!\n",

      "However it is not at all balanced by the US perspective.  This makes it appear not NPOV in my view.  Problems include.\n",
      "1.  There is a dispute of whether the documents were requested or not.\n",
      "2.  It a large change from standard extradition requests, the Swiss evaluated the merits of the case, and the punishment used.  They speculated that the 42 days of evaluation could have been the entire sentence.   That speculation is defense argument for matters that have not been determined in the courts.  In this way the Swiss became a judge of the case, to which the US was not allowed to argue against.  This deviation from standard means of handling extradition requests is already being speculated to have a lasting impact on other cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the concerns on the other side of what is currently written:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Swiss government said its decision to reject extradition was partly based on U.S. authorities' failure to turn over transcripts of secret testimony given by the attorney who originally handled the director's case. The testimony \"\"should prove\"\" that Polanski already served his sentence with the court-ordered diagnostic study, the Swiss Justice Ministry said.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The main issue appeared to be how the Swiss government expanded its focus beyond the formalities of the American extradition request to pass judgment on allegations of misconduct by Los Angeles authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"This was an admission that when higher interests are at stake, not everyone is equal before the law,\"\" wrote the widely respected Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper. \"\"Some are a bit more equal.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Zurich paper, the Tages-Anzeiger, called the Swiss decision \"\"shaky.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"It breaks with the tradition of only examining the formal correctness of extradition requests,\"\" it said. \"\"Perhaps the new practice will in the future also benefit detainees who have less of a lobby than the world-famous director.\"\"\n",

      "ALL of this does not explain why Polanski skipped out of his sentencing hearing, if he believed he had served his sentence, and when he quite capable lawyers representing him before the judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I see the rational used by the Swiss to be controverted and biased to the defense agreements, which have never been tested before a court of law.  To where these arguments were argued, the Judges refused to grant their merit.  The method the Swiss used to determine the extradition request is entirely new.  So I believe these sentences in the section either need balancing of the two sides, and or pared down.   \n",

      "As the article is essentially about the original game, it's pretty much assumed that the gameplay and plot sections refers to the NES version's gameplay. Therefore I believe \"\"(NES version)\"\" in the caption of the first two images in the body are unnecessary, while the image of the WSC version needs to state that it's from the WSC version.\n",
      "There are several parentheses throughout the plot section that confuse me. Example: \"\"Lefeinish (Lufenian)\"\". I think it refers to the original name, and to the name used in later versions in parenthesis, but I'm not sure. Anyway, if I'm correct, I think the parentheses can be removed, based on my first comment. A hidden note could also be added, telling the reader that the name's refer to the original game.\n",

      "I really disagree with you. Anyone who, like myself, lived in FRY and S&M; understand how much different were political structures of these countries. FRY was a federation (at least nominally), while S&M; was a outright confederation. It's really indicative that the position of federal Prime Minister was abolished in 2003, and merged with the position of President. Separate articles are need in this case; we can't merge different articles on Wikipedia just because someone wants \"\"information in one place\"\". Also, you said that in 2002, the country was renamed to \"\"S&M;\"\". It's a mistake; that happened in 2003.   \"\n",

      "\"What, pray tell, makes a person \"\"Basque\"\" in your mind? Is it the fact that they speak Basque with fluency? If so, then by this definition you yourself would not qualify as Basque. Is it the presence of \"\"Basque\"\" surnames por los cuatro costados? Again, if so, by this definition you would not qualify as \"\"Basque.\"\" Is it the fact that you were born in El País Vasco? If that's the essential qualifier then your good friend King could not be considered Basque. Is it subscription to a belief that El País Vasco should have ever greater autonomy or even total independence? If so, then some fluent Basque speakers of ancient Basque ancestry would find themselves in the absurd position of not really being Basque.

When he claims that \"\"There is no reliable, published source that states that he has two wives and this is slanderous if untrue\"\" he uses the phrase \"\"if untrue\"\" only because he knows he has had a wedding with Sabiya Amanat and a wedding with Helena Houdova while to-date not having had a divorce from either of these two wives in any jurisdiction where the wedding ceremonies took place or where they reside.\"\" Such deletions prevent the ability for discussions to occur and have nothing to do with personal attacks in as much as I have followed this too. IF Wikipedia articles are meant to be an accurate representation of the subjects then discussions need to be allowed, for otherwise this will be just a soapbox for the likes of Rumination.\n",
